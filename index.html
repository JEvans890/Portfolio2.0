        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>Hello! First of all, thank you for visiting my page! My name nickname is Jack, and I was born and raised
            inside
            of Las Vegas, NV where I stayed for 23 years. Some of My education includes:
    </div>
    <ul class="list">
        <li>Graduating Highschool at Shadow Ridge</li>
        <li>Obtaining my Basic and Advanced certifications as an Emergency Medical Technician (EMT) from EMS
            Training Center</li>
        <li>Some college credits towards an Associates degree in Paramedicine at the College of Southern Nevada
            (CSN)
        </li>
        <li>Certifications as a Firefighter 1 and Hazardous Materials Awareness and Operations</li>
    </ul>
    Before Moving to the Portland, OR area, I had the opportunity to pursue my passion for emergency responding
    through
    my work experience at <strong>Medicwest Ambulance, Community Ambulance, Las Vegas Fire & Rescue, and Clark
        County
        Fire Department</strong>.

            I always had an inclination towards entrepreneurship, but being so enveloped in studying and physical
            fitness to
            be the best at my job, I had not figured out exactly what I wanted to pursue in that regard. After
            deciding to
            leave, I found a passion for mushrooms and decided to go full-force with the work ethic I had obtained
            from my
            previous experiences to create my company, <a href="https://mushroommedic.org">MushroomMedic!</a> By
            trying to
            achieve this goal, I have continued to educate myself in mushroom cultivation and am currently pursuing
            a
            certification in Web Development at <a href="https://www.epicodus.com/" alt="Epicodus Website">Epicodus</a>.
